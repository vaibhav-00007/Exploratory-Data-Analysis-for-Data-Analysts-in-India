# üìä Data Analytics Job Market in India ‚Äì Exploratory Data Analysis

This project is an end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the **Data Analytics job market in India**, where I analyze job trends, salary ranges, and required skills. As an **aspiring data analyst**, I took on this project both to **strengthen my technical skills** and to **understand the market I‚Äôm preparing for**.

## üéØ Project Goals

- Identify **high-demand skills** in the Indian data job market
- Analyze **salary patterns** across roles, locations, and skills
- Determine the **most valuable skill combinations**
- Showcase **real-world data analysis skills** using Python and Jupyter Notebooks

## üìà Key Insights 

### üß† Top In-Demand Skills:
![Top In-Demand Skills](images/Images/6_%25%20Skill%20Counts.png)

- **SQL** is the core skill for Data Analysts. **Excel** and BI tools like **Tableau** & **Power BI** are still heavily used.
- **SQL** and **Python** are essential for data engineers. Meanwhile, Cloud and big data tools like **Spark**, **AWS**, and **Azure** show a strong presence.
- Data Scientists are expected to code (**Python**, **R**), query databases(**SQL**), and also work on cloud (**AWS**) or visualization platforms (**Tableau**).

### ‚öôÔ∏è Skill Trends:

- SQL is a non-negotiable skill, appearing in over 60% of postings.
- Python (~44%) consistently ranks slightly higher than Excel (~39%) in job postings yearly, indicating that employers are increasingly preferring candidates who can automate and scale analyses.
- Power BI shows faster market growth (+160% YoY), while Tableau maintains steady demand (+75%).


### üí∞ Salary Distribution by Role (USD):

- Data Analyst is a solid entry point, but transitioning can yield 60‚Äì80% higher pay.
- Machine Learning Engineers** command the highest median salary.
- 
### üíº Highest Paid Skills: 

- PostgreSQL, PySpark, and GitLab are the top 3 highest-paying skills for Data Analysts.
- Most top-paying tools are back-end or data engineering-focused, highlighting the importance of cross-functional data skills.

- Power BI and Spark dominate both salary and demand ‚Äî a great skill combo for BI + big data.
- Python and SQL remain the core foundational tools, with high job market saturation.
- Cloud platforms (Azure, AWS) offer moderate pay, likely more valuable when combined with other skills.

### üîπ Most optimal Skills:

**High Demand & Good Salary:**
- **Python** (around 42% of jobs, ~$96K median salary): A versatile programming language crucial for data manipulation, analysis, and machine learning.
- **Excel** (around 41% of jobs, ~$99K median salary): Still a fundamental tool for data handling, cleaning, and basic analysis.
